Preliminary installation instructions:

If you have a source tarball (i.e., a tgz file containing a directory called 'src'),
unpack it, 'cd' into it and run 'python setup.py build'.

This should work, provided you have the following installed on your system:
- Python, at least version 2.5, including development files. 
- NumPy (a numerics package for Python)
- the GNU development toolchain, i.e., GCC etc.

If you have write permissions for Python's library directory, you can then
install HTSeq with 'python setup.py install'. If you don't, have a look into
the directory 'build' that 'setup.py build' has created. It contains a directory
'lib.<your_OS_name>', which in turn contains 'HTSeq'. Set the environment variable
'PYTHONPATH' to point to the full path of the 'lib.<your_os_name>' directory, so that
Python can find the HTSeq directory.

Hints for Mac Users:
- MacOS X Snow Leopard has Python and NumPy pre-installed. Leopard as well, I suppose,
but I haven't checked yet.
- For GCC etc, simply install Xcode. (Download it from the Apple web site of look at
the second of your two Mac OS X installation CDs.)

Hint for Ubuntu users:
- For Python, use the package manager to install package 'python2.6-dev' 
  (or python2.5-dev).
- For Numpy, install package 'python-numpy'.
- For GCC etc., install package 'build-essential'.

Hints for Windows users:
None. Sorry, I haven't tried to compile this for Windows yet.
