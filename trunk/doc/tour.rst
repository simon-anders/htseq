********************
A tour through HTSeq
********************

This tour demonstrates the
functionality of HTSeq by performing a number of common analysis tasks:

- Getting statistical summaries about the base-call quality scores to
  study the data quality.
- Calculating a coverage vector and exporting it for visualization in
  a genome browser.
- Reading in annotation data from a GFF file.
- Assigning aligned reads from an RNA-Seq experiments to exons and
  genes.

  
The following description assumes that the reader is familiar with Python and with HTS
data.
  

Reading in reads
================

In the example data, a FASTQ file is provided with example reads from a yeast RNA-Seq
experiment. The file ``yeast_RNASeq_excerpt_sequence.txt`` is an excerpt of the
``_sequence.txt`` file produced by the SolexaPipeline software. We can access it from
HTSeq with

::

   >>> import HTSeq
   >>> fastq_file = HTSeq.FastqReader( "yeast_RNASeq_excerpt_sequence.txt", "solexa" )
  
The first argument is the file name, the optional second argument indicates that 
the quality values are encoded according to Solexa's specification. If you omit it,
the default "phred" is assumed, which means the encoding originally suggested
by the Sanger Institute. (A third option is "solexa_old", for data from the SolexaPipeline
prior to version 1.3.)

The variable ``fastq_file`` now refers to the file::

   >>> fastq_file
   <FastqReader object, connected to file name 'yeast_RNASeq_excerpt_sequence.txt'>
  
When used in a ``for`` loop, it generates an iterator of objects representing the
reads. Here, we use the ``islice`` function from ``itertools`` to cut after 10
reads.

::

   >>> import itertools
   >>> for read in itertools.islice( fastq_file, 10 ):
   ...    print read
   CTTACGTTTTCTGTATCAATACTCGATTTATCATCT
   AATTGGTTTCCCCGCCGAGACCGTACACTACCAGCC

   AAGAGGTTTGAGATCTTTGACCACCGTCTGGGCTGA
   GTCATCACTATCAGAGAAGGTAGAACATTGGAAGAT
   ACTTTTAAAGATTGGCCAAGAATTGGGGATTGAAGA
   
Of course, there is more to a read than its sequence. The variable ``read`` still
contains the tenth read, and we may examine it::

   >>> read
   <SequenceWithQualities object 'HWI-EAS225:1:10:1284:142#0/1'>

A ``Sequence`` object has two slots, called ``seq`` and ``name``. This here is
a ``SequenceWithQualities``, and it also has a slot ``qual``::

   >>> read.name
   'HWI-EAS225:1:10:1284:142#0/1'
   >>> read.seq
   'ACTTTTAAAGATTGGCCAAGAATTGGGGATTGAAGA'
   >>> read.qual
   array([ 33.,  33.,  33.,  33.,  33.,  33.,  29.,  27.,  29.,  32.,  29.,
           30.,  30.,  21.,  22.,  25.,  25.,  25.,  23.,  28.,  24.,  24.,
           29.,  29.,  29.,  25.,  28.,  24.,  24.,  26.,  25.,  25.,  24.,
           24.,  24.,  24.])

The values in the quality array are, for each base in the sequence, the Phred
score for the correctness of the base.

As a first simple example for the use of HTSeq, we now calculate the average
quality score for each position in the reads by adding up the ``qual`` arrays 
from all reads and the dividing by the number of reads. We sum everything up in
the variable ``qualsum``, a ``numpy`` array of integers::

   >>> import numpy
   >>> len( read )
   36
   >>> qualsum = numpy.zeros( len(read), numpy.int )

Then we loop through the fastq file, adding up the quality scores and
counting the reads::

   >>> nreads = 0
   >>> for read in fastq_file:
   ...    qualsum += read.qual
   ...    nreads += 1

The average qualities are hence::

   >>> qualsum / float(nreads)
   array([ 31.56838274,  30.08288332,  29.4375375 ,  29.00432017,
           28.55290212,  28.26825073,  28.46681867,  27.59082363,
           27.34097364,  27.57330293,  27.11784471,  27.19432777,
           26.84023361,  26.76267051,  26.44885795,  26.79135165,
           26.42901716,  26.49849994,  26.13604544,  25.95823833,
           25.54922197,  26.20460818,  25.42333693,  25.72298892,
           25.04164167,  24.75151006,  24.48561942,  24.27061082,
           24.10720429,  23.68026721,  23.52034081,  23.49437978,
           23.11076443,  22.5576223 ,  22.43549742,  22.62354494])

If you have ``matplotlib`` installed, you can plot this.

.. doctest::

   >>> from matplotlib import pyplot      
   >>> pyplot.plot( qualsum / nreads )    #doctest:+ELLIPSIS
   [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
   >>> pyplot.show()                      #doctest:+SKIP 

.. image:: qualplot.png

This is a very simple way of looking at the quality scores. For more sophisticated 
quality-control techniques, see [to be filled in].


What if you did not get the ``_sequence.txt`` file from your core facility but 
instead the ``export.txt`` file? While the former contains only the reads and
their quality, the latter also contains the alignment of the reads to a reference
as found by Eland. To read it, simply use

.. doctest::

   >>> alignment_file = HTSeq.SolexaExportReader( "yeast_RNASeq_excerpt_export.txt" )  #doctest:+SKIP
   
`HTSeq` can also use other alignment formats, e.g., SAM::   
   
   >>> alignment_file = HTSeq.SAM_Reader( "yeast_RNASeq_excerpt.sam" )
   
If we are only interested in the qualities, we can rewrite the commands from above
to use the `alignment_file`::

   >>> nreads = 0
   >>> for aln in alignment_file:
   ...    qualsum += aln.read.qual
   ...    nreads += 1

We have simple replaced the ``FastqReader`` with a ``SolexaExportReader``, which 
iterates, when used in a ``for`` loop, over ``SolexaAlignment``objects. Each of
these contain a field ``read`` that contains the ``SequenceWithQualities``, as
before. There are more parses, for example the ``SAM_Parser`` that can read SAM
files, and generates ``SAM_Alignment`` objects. As all ``Alignment`` object
contain a ``read`` slot with the ``SequenceWithQualities``, we can use the same
code with any alignment filw for which a parser has been provided, and all we have
to change is the name of the reader class in the first line.

The other fields that all ``Alignment`` objects contain, is a Boolean called ``aligned``
that tells us whether the read has been aligned at all, and a field called ``iv``
(for "interval") that shows where teh read was aligned to. We use this information in
the next section.



Calculating coverage vectors
============================

By a "coverage vector", we mean a vector (one-dimensional array) of the length of
a chromosome, where each element counts how many reads cover the correspoding
base pair in their alignment. As chromosomes can be very long, it would be very 
inefficient to hold a coverage vector in memory by reserving space for each base
pair. Rather, we take advantage of the fact that the value of the coverage vector
usually stays constant (often it is just zero) over stretches of varying length,
which we call steps. A ``StepVector`` is a data structure defined for this purpose.

It works as follows: Let's define a ``Stepvector`` of length 30::

   >>> sv = HTSeq.StepVector.StepVector( 30 )
   
Initially, it has value 0 everywhere. We set the positions 7 to 15 to the value 120::

   >>> sv[ 7:15 ] = 120

Internally, ``sv`` now does not hold 30 numbers, but 3 steps, as follows::

   >>> list( sv.get_steps() )
   [(0, 7, 0.0), (7, 15, 120.0), (15, 30, 0.0)]

Each step is a triple, giving start, end and value of the step. If we now add the
value 100 to the positions 10 to 20, the steps get split accordingly::

   >>> sv.add_value( 100, 10, 20 )
   >>> list( sv.get_steps() )
   [(0, 7, 0.0), (7, 10, 120.0), (10, 15, 220.0), (15, 20, 100.0), (20, 30, 0.0)]
   
If you iterate over a ``StepVector``, it behaves like a list::

.. doctest::

   >>> list( sv )   #doctest:+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
   [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 120.0, 120.0, 120.0, 220.0, 220.0, 220.0, 
   220.0, 220.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 
   0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
   
You can also take parts of a ``StepVector``, which produces a new, shorter, ``StepVector``.

.. doctest::

   >>> sv[6:12]   # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
   <StepVector object, type 'd', index range 6:12, 3 step(s)>
   >>> sv[6:12].get_steps()        #doctest:+ELLIPSIS
   <generator object ...>
   >>> list( sv[6:12].get_steps() )
   [(6, 7, 0.0), (7, 10, 120.0), (10, 12, 220.0)]
   >>> list( sv[6:12] )
   [0.0, 120.0, 120.0, 120.0, 220.0, 220.0]


   
In practice, you will not work with ``StepVector``s directly, but rather with objects
of class ``GenomicArray``. These hold several step vectors, either one for each chromosome   
("non-stranded genomic array") or one for each strand, i.e., two per chromosome
("stranded genomic array"). To specify the locations of steps on a ``GenomicArray``, objects
of class ``GenomicInterval`` are used, which are instantiated by specifying chromsome
name, start, end, and position::

   >>> iv = HTSeq.GenomicInterval( "II", 100234, 100789, "+" )
   >>> iv
   <GenomicInterval object 'II', [100234,100789), strand '+'>
   >>> print iv
   II:[100234,100789)/+
   
A ``GenomicInterval`` has four slots which allow to access its data::
   
   >>> iv.chrom
   'II'
   >>> iv.start
   100234
   >>> iv.end
   100789
   >>> iv.strand
   '+'
   
Two notes: ``chrom`` does not have to be chromosome, it could also be a contig name,
or any other identifier. ``strand`` can be ``+``, ``-``, or ``.``, where the latter
means "no strand", to be used whenever specifying a strand would be meaning-less.

A ``GenomicInterval`` has some more features, e.g., to calculate overlaps etc. See
[...] for these.


In order to calculate the coverage vectors for our yeast RNA-Seq data, we first need
to knwo the lengths of the chromosomes. One might take them from the lengths of
the reference FASTA files, but we simply specify the values here::

   >>> yeast_chrom_lengths = {
   ...    "2-micron": 6318,
   ...    "MT":    85779,
   ...    "I":    230208,
   ...    "II":   813178,
   ...    "III":  316617,
   ...    "IV":  1531918,
   ...    "V":    576869,
   ...    "VI":   270148,
   ...    "VII": 1090946,
   ...    "VIII": 562643,
   ...    "IX":   439885,
   ...    "X":    745745,
   ...    "XI":   666454,
   ...    "XII": 1078175,
   ...    "XIII": 924429,
   ...    "XIV":  784333,
   ...    "XV":  1091289,
   ...    "XVI":  948062
   ... }

Now, we define a ``GenomicArray``:

   >>> cvg = HTSeq.GenomicArray( yeast_chrom_lengths, stranded=True, typecode='i' )
   
As we specified ``stranded=True``, there are now two ``StepVector``s for each
chromosome, all holding integer values (``typecode='i'``):

   >>> import pprint
   >>> pprint.pprint( cvg.step_vectors )
   {'2-micron': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:6318, 1 step(s)>,
                 '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:6318, 1 step(s)>},
    'I': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:230208, 1 step(s)>,
          '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:230208, 1 step(s)>},
    'II': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:813178, 1 step(s)>,
           '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:813178, 1 step(s)>},
    'III': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:316617, 1 step(s)>,
            '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:316617, 1 step(s)>},
    'IV': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:1531918, 1 step(s)>,
           '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:1531918, 1 step(s)>},
    'IX': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:439885, 1 step(s)>,
           '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:439885, 1 step(s)>},
    'MT': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:85779, 1 step(s)>,
           '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:85779, 1 step(s)>},
    'V': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:576869, 1 step(s)>,
          '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:576869, 1 step(s)>},
    'VI': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:270148, 1 step(s)>,
           '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:270148, 1 step(s)>},
    'VII': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:1090946, 1 step(s)>,
            '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:1090946, 1 step(s)>},
    'VIII': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:562643, 1 step(s)>,
             '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:562643, 1 step(s)>},
    'X': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:745745, 1 step(s)>,
          '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:745745, 1 step(s)>},
    'XI': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:666454, 1 step(s)>,
           '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:666454, 1 step(s)>},
    'XII': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:1078175, 1 step(s)>,
            '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:1078175, 1 step(s)>},
    'XIII': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:924429, 1 step(s)>,
             '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:924429, 1 step(s)>},
    'XIV': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:784333, 1 step(s)>,
            '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:784333, 1 step(s)>},
    'XV': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:1091289, 1 step(s)>,
           '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:1091289, 1 step(s)>},
    'XVI': {'+': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:948062, 1 step(s)>,
            '-': <StepVector object, type 'i', index range 0:948062, 1 step(s)>}}

The integer values are all initialized to 0. We may put them to a value, say 100,
at the genomic interval ``iv`` defined above::

   >>> cvg[ iv ] = 100
 
If we want to add a value, we use::

   >>> cvg.add_value( 50, iv )
   
To see the effect, let's make the interval slightly longer and then look at the steps::

   >>> iv.start -= 30
   >>> iv.end += 100
   >>> pprint.pprint( list( cvg.get_steps( iv ) ) )
   [(<GenomicInterval object 'II', [100204,100234), strand '+'>, 0),
    (<GenomicInterval object 'II', [100234,100789), strand '+'>, 150),
    (<GenomicInterval object 'II', [100789,100889), strand '+'>, 0)]

With these tools, we can now calculate the coverage vector very easily. We just iterate
through all the reads and add the value 1 at the interval to which each read was aligned
to::

   >>> alignment_file = HTSeq.SAM_Reader( "yeast_RNASeq_excerpt.sam" )
   >>> cvg = HTSeq.GenomicArray( yeast_chrom_lengths, stranded=True, typecode='i' )
   >>> for alngt in alignment_file:
   ...    if alngt.aligned:
   ...       cvg.add_value( 1, alngt.iv )

We can plot an excerpt of this with::

.. doctest::

   >>> pyplot.plot( list( cvg[ HTSeq.GenomicInterval( "III", 200000, 500000, "+" ) ] ) )     #doctest:+ELLIPSIS
   [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
   
However, a proper genome browser gives a better impression of the data. The following commands
write two BedGraph (Wiggle) files, one for the plus and one for the minus strands::

   >>> cvg.write_bedgraph_file( "plus.wig", "+" )
   >>> cvg.write_bedgraph_file( "minus.wig", "-" )
   
These two files can then be viewed in a genome browser (e.g. IGB_), alongside the 
annotation from a GFF file (see below).

Counting reads by genes
=======================

As the example data is from an RNA-Seq experiment, we want to know how many reads fall into
the exonic regions of each gene. For this purpose we first need to read in information about the
positions of the exons. A convenient source of such information are the GTF files from 
Ensembl_ (to be found here_).

.. _Ensembl: http://www.ensembl.org/index.html
.. _here: ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_gtf/

These file are in the `GTF format`, a tightening of the `GFF format`. `HTSeq` offers the
`GFF_Reader` class to read in a GFF file:

.. _`GTF format`: http://mblab.wustl.edu/GTF22.html
.. _`GFF format`: http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/gff/spec.html

   >>> gtf_file = HTSeq.GFF_Reader( "Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.SGD1.01.56.gtf.gz" )
   >>> for feature in itertools.islice( gtf_file, 10 ):
   ...    print feature
   ... 
   <GenomicFeature: exon 'R0010W' at 2-micron: 251 -> 1523 (strand '+')>
   <GenomicFeature: CDS 'R0010W' at 2-micron: 251 -> 1520 (strand '+')>
   <GenomicFeature: start_codon 'R0010W' at 2-micron: 251 -> 254 (strand '+')>
   <GenomicFeature: stop_codon 'R0010W' at 2-micron: 1520 -> 1523 (strand '+')>
   <GenomicFeature: exon 'R0020C' at 2-micron: 3007 -> 1887 (strand '-')>
   <GenomicFeature: CDS 'R0020C' at 2-micron: 3007 -> 1890 (strand '-')>
   <GenomicFeature: start_codon 'R0020C' at 2-micron: 3007 -> 3006 (strand '-')>
   <GenomicFeature: stop_codon 'R0020C' at 2-micron: 1888 -> 1887 (strand '-')>
   <GenomicFeature: exon 'R0030W' at 2-micron: 3270 -> 3816 (strand '+')>
   <GenomicFeature: CDS 'R0030W' at 2-micron: 3270 -> 3813 (strand '+')>

The ``feature`` variable is filled with objects of class ``GenomicFeature``. As with all Python
objects, the ``dir`` function shows us its slots and functions::

.. doctest::

   >>> dir( feature )   #doctest:+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE,+ELLIPSIS
   ['__class__', ..., '__weakref__', 'attr', 'frame', 'get_gff_line', 
   'iv', 'name', 'score', 'source', 'type']
   
Ignoring the attributes starting with an underscore, we can see now how to access 
the information stored in the GFF file. The information from the columns of the GFF
table is accessable as follows::

   >>> feature.iv
   <GenomicInterval object '2-micron', [3270,3813), strand '+'>
   >>> feature.source
   'protein_coding'
   >>> feature.type
   'CDS'
   >>> feature.score
   '.'

The last column (the attributes) is parsed and presented as a `dict`::

.. doctest::

   >>> feature.attr    #doctest:+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
   {'exon_number': '1', 'gene_id': 'R0030W', 'transcript_name': 'RAF1', 
   'transcript_id': 'R0030W', 'protein_id': 'R0030W', 'gene_name': 'RAF1'}
   
The very first attribute in this column is usually some kind of ID, hence it is
stored in the slot `name`:

   >>> feature.name
   'R0030W'

To deal with this data, we will use a ``GenomicArray``. A ``GenomicArray`` can store 
not only numerical data but also arbitrary Python objects (with `typecode` `'O'`).
Hence, we can assign those features that correspond to exons, to steps in the ``GenomicArray``::

   >>> exons = HTSeq.GenomicArray( yeast_chrom_lengths, stranded=False, typecode='O' )
   >>> for feature in gtf_file:
   ...    if feature.type == "exon":
   ...       exons[ feature.iv ] = feature

Now, we can ask what exons occur in a certain interval::

   >>> iv = HTSeq.GenomicInterval( "II", 120000, 125000, "." )
   >>> pprint.pprint( list( exons.get_steps( iv ) ) )
   [(<GenomicInterval object 'II', [120000,121877), strand '.'>,
     <GenomicFeature: exon 'YBL052C' at II: 121876 -> 119382 (strand '-')>),
    (<GenomicInterval object 'II', [121877,122755), strand '.'>, None),
    (<GenomicInterval object 'II', [122755,124762), strand '.'>,
     <GenomicFeature: exon 'YBL051C' at II: 124761 -> 122756 (strand '-')>),
    (<GenomicInterval object 'II', [124762,125000), strand '.'>, None)]

However, our RNA-Seq experiment was not strand-specific, i.e., we do not know whether
the reads came from the plus or the minus strand. This is why we defined the ``GenomicArray``
as non-stranded (``stranded=False`` in the instantiation of ``exons`` above), intructing
it to ignore all strand information. An issue with this is that we now have many overlapping
genes and the simple assignment ``exons[ feature.iv ] = feature`` is overwriting, so that
it is not clear which feature we set.

The proper solution is to store not just single features at an interval but sets of all
features which are present there. A specialization of ``GenomicArray``, ``GenomicArrayOfSets``
is offered to simplify this::

   >>> exons = HTSeq.GenomicArrayOfSets( yeast_chrom_lengths, stranded=False )

We populate the array again with the feature data. This time, we use the ``add_value``
method, which adds an object without overwriting what might already be there. Instead,
it uses sets to deal with overlaps. (Also, we only store the gene name this time, as this
will be more convenient later).
 
   >>> for feature in gtf_file:
   ...    if feature.type == "exon":
   ...       exons.add_value( feature.name, feature.iv )

Assume we have a read covering this interval::

   >>> iv = HTSeq.GenomicInterval( "III", 23850, 23950, "." )

Its left half covers two genes (YCL058C, YCL058W-A), but its right half only
YCL058C because YCL058W-A end in the middle of the read::

   >>> pprint.pprint( list( exons.get_steps( iv ) ) )
   [(<GenomicInterval object 'III', [23850,23925), strand '.'>,
     set(['YCL058C', 'YCL058W-A'])),
    (<GenomicInterval object 'III', [23925,23950), strand '.'>, set(['YCL058C']))]

Assuming the transcription boundaries in our GTF file to be correct, we may conclude
that this read is from the gene that appears in both steps and not from the one that
appears in only one of the steps. More generally, whenever a read overlaps multiple 
steps (a new step starts wherever a feature starts or ends), we get a set of feature
names for each step, and we have to find the intersection of all these. This can be
coded as follows::

   >>> intersection_set = None
   >>> for step_set in exons.get_steps( iv, values_only=True ):
   ...    if intersection_set is None:
   ...       intersection_set = step_set
   ...    else:
   ...       intersection_set.intersection_update( step_set )
   ... 
   >>> print intersection_set
   set(['YCL058C'])

Here, we have used the ``values_only`` option of ``get_steps``, as we are not
interested in the intervals, only in the sets. We also used the ``intersection_update`` 
method Python's standard ``set`` class, which performs a set intersection in 
place. Afterwards, we have a set with precisely one element. Getting this one 
element is a tiny bit cumbersome; to access it, one needs to write::

   >>> list(intersection_set)[0]
   'YCL058C'

In this way, we can go through all our aligned reads, calculate the intersection
set, and, if it contains a single gene name, add a count for this gene. For the
counters, we use a dict, which we initialize with a zero for each gene name::

   >>> counts = {}
   >>> for feature in gtf_file:
   ...    if feature.type == "exon":
   ...       counts[ feature.name ] = 0

Now, we can finally count::

   >>> sam_file = HTSeq.SAM_Reader( "yeast_RNASeq_excerpt.sam" )
   >>> for alnmt in sam_file:
   ...    if alnmt.aligned:
   ...       intersection_set = None
   ...       for step_set in exons.get_steps( alnmt.iv, values_only=True ):
   ...           if intersection_set is None:
   ...              intersection_set = step_set
   ...           else:
   ...              intersection_set.intersection_update( step_set )
   ...    if len( intersection_set ) == 1:
   ...       counts[ list(intersection_set)[0] ] += 1

We can now conveniently print the result with::

   >>> for name in sorted( counts.keys() ):
